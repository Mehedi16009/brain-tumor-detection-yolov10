Note on Results Reproducibility:
The highest mAP@50 achieved on Dataset-2 was 96.0% after training for 150 epochs. This was obtained during an earlier training session on Google Colab, but could not be exactly reproduced in later runs, possibly due to different training seeds, session constraints, or hyperparameter drift.
The original training notebook that produced this result is available in "brain-tumor-detection-yolov10/dataset_figshare/Dataset convert and Training_Evaluation/Dataset 2 Final train Results at 150 Epochs.png".
Current training scripts and configurations are still closely aligned and achieve mAP@50 between 93%â€“95%, which is consistent and robust.
